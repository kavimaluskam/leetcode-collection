## Problem

<p>Given an array <code>nums</code> of <em>n</em> integers, are there elements <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, <em>c</em> in <code>nums</code> such that <em>a</em> + <em>b</em> + <em>c</em> = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.</p>

<p>Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong> nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
<strong>Output:</strong> [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]
</pre><p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong> nums = []
<strong>Output:</strong> []
</pre><p><strong>Example 3:</strong></p>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong> nums = [0]
<strong>Output:</strong> []
</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>0 &lt;= nums.length &lt;= 3000</code></li>
	<li><code>-10<sup>5</sup> &lt;= nums[i] &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>
</ul>

## Discussion

An extended version of [1. Two Sum](./1_two-sum.md).
Based on our result in Two Sum, we have a result of `O(n)` solution with
two integer in the input, we can target a solution for this problem
of `O(n^2)`.

If we simply enhanced the solution based on Two Sum, we have to figure out the
de-duplication step. And as the solution should be of `O(n^2)`, we can try
to sort the input array first.

And based on this, we can try to use a pointer approach to scan all the
elements within each iteration.

### Solution

Our solution begins with sorting the input list, then a loop iterating along
the input list.

In each iteration, we will use a 2-pointer approach to scan all the pairs
of elements.

As duplicate elements may appears and we want to avoid same combination,
we will try to skip the first elements by skipping the element same with
the previous one.

We will define the two pointers as the beginning and the end of the remaining
sub list. Similarly we will update the first element if it's same as
the previous one.

Then we simply evaluate the same of the three elements. If it is positive we
will try to reduce it's value, then we update the last element with a smaller
index, vice versa for negative value.

```py3
class Solution:
    def threeSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        nums.sort()
        result = []

        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if i > 0 and nums[i - 1] == nums[i]:
                continue

            left, right = i + 1, len(nums) - 1

            while left < right:
                if left > i + 1 and nums[left - 1] == nums[left]:
                    left += 1
                    continue

                value = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right]

                if value > 0:
                    right -= 1

                elif value < 0:
                    left += 1

                else:
                    result.append([nums[i], nums[left], nums[right]])
                    left += 1
                    right -= 1

        return result
```

### Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: `O(n^2)`, as a double loop is implemented.

- Space Complexity: `O(1)`, as only constant value is saved in memory.
